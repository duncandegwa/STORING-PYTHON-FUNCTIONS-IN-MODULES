### STORING-PYTHON-FUNCTIONS-IN-MODULES


One advantage of functions is the way they separate blocks of code from 
your main program. By using descriptive names for your functions, your 
main program will be much easier to follow. You can go a step further by 
storing your functions in a separate file called a module and then importing
that module into your main program. An import statement tells Python to 
make the code in a module available in the currently running program file.
Storing your functions in a separate file allows you to hide the details of 
your programâ€™s code and focus on its higher-level logic. It also allows you to 
reuse functions in many different programs. When you store your functions 
in separate files, you can share those files with other programmers without 
having to share your entire program. Knowing how to import functions 
also allows you to use libraries of functions that other programmers have 
written.

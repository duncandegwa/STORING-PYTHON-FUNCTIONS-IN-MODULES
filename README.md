Testing Your Python Code

### Introduction paragraph (2-3 paragraphs):
When you write a function or a class, you can also write tests for that code. Testing proves that your code works as it’s supposed to in response to all the input types it’s designed to receive. When you write tests, you can be confident that your code will work correctly as more people begin to use your programs. You’ll also be able to test 
new code as you add it to make sure your changes don’t break your program’s existing behavior. Every programmer makes mistakes, so every programmer must test their code often,catching problems before users encounter them.

In this article you’ll learn to test your code using tools in Python’s unittest module. You’ll learn to build a test case and check that a set of inputs results in the output you want. You’ll see what a passing test looks like and what a failing test looks like, and you’ll learn how a failing test can help you improve your code. You’ll learn to test functions, and you’ll start to understand how many tests to write for a project.

### Key takeaways: 

Testing a Function
Unit Tests and Test Cases
A Passing Test
A Failing Test
Responding to a Failed Test
